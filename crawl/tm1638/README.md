# TM1638 experiment

This was created using `cargo generate` from https://github.com/bentwire/embassy-rp2040-template .  I chose "yes" to all
the options like USB and networking support.  Probably unnecessarily.

This is just an experiment.  I want to adapt the C++ code at https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/TM1638plus_PICO to async
Rust using Embassy, and be able to communicate with the TM1638-based board I have for experiments.
